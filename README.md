# Issue Tracker

Track, manage, filter, sort, rank, nest & mix ordered & unordered issues in your dev projects & have an overview of all issues regardless of the project in 1 table.

## Where to try the app for free & future of *Issue Tracker*

Read more & try the (free) app here: https://issue-tracker-react-ts.vercel.app/about *(I'm using it everyday)*.

You may also be interested in my other great app - [Linky Notes](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/about) - which allows you to create, organize & filter your notes with one or more tags & style them with Markdown syntax *(I'm using it everyday too)*.

*Issue Tracker* & *Linky Notes* are stable & will be not extended in the future. Instead, they will be combined into one app & all of their features will be not only combined, but shared & extended.

So stay tuned! I will inform users of mentioned apps about the new app, when it will be published!
