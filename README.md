# Issue Tracker

The app allows you to manage issues in your projects & store all of the data in your browser's local storage.

Why not use of any cloud db? At the moment I'm focusing on learning TypeScript than using Firebase I've used so many times before... I will add storing data in Firebase, but this will be done in the end of developing process.
